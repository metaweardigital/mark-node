# Current Research

This directory contains active research documents for features currently being worked on.

## Active Documents

*Empty - no active research*

## Usage

When a sub-agent is asked to research a feature, it should:
1. Create a new markdown file here with findings
2. Structure the document clearly with headings
3. Include code examples, best practices, and recommendations
4. Update this README with the new document

## Cleanup

After a feature is complete, move documents to `/archive/` with proper organization.
