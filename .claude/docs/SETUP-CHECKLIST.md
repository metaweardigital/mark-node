## How to Use This Template

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the template
git clone [template-repo]
cd claude-code-template

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup MCP servers
npm run mcp:setup

# Initialize Claude Code
claude /init

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

### 2. Configure for Your Project

#### Update CLAUDE.md
- Replace `[Add your tech stack here]` with actual stack
- Add project-specific conventions
- Update test commands with actual commands

#### Customize Agents
- Modify agent templates for your tech stack
- Add project-specific patterns
- Include domain knowledge

#### Update MCP Configuration

### 3. Start Development

#### With Claude Code
```bash
# Start Claude session
claude

# Or resume previous session
claude --continue
```

#### Using MCP Servers
```bash
# Claude can now:
"Take a screenshot of the login page"  # Uses Playwright MCP
"Check the database for user records"  # Uses Postgres MCP
"Review PR #123"                       # Uses GitHub MCP
```

#### TDD Workflow
```bash
# Ask Claude to write tests first
"Write tests for the payment feature"

# Claude will:
# 1. Create test files
# 2. Write failing tests
# 3. Implement the feature
# 4. Ensure tests pass
```

### 4. Visual Testing Loop
```bash
# Implement feature
"Create the user dashboard"

"Take a screenshot of the dashboard"

# Claude analyzes and suggests improvements
# Iterate until perfect
```

### 5. Deployment
```bash

"Commit and create PR for this feature"

# GitHub Actions run automatically:
# - Tests
# - Linting
# - Claude Code review
# - Deployment to staging
```
