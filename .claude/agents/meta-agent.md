- [Code patterns to follow]
- [Test examples]

## Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Frequently used commands
[command 1]
[command 2]
\`\`\`

## Output Format
[Expected deliverables]
```

## Usage Examples

### Create Feature Agent
```bash
"Create an agent specialized in implementing the payment feature"
# Generates: payment-feature-agent.md
```

### Create Integration Agent
```bash
"Create an agent for Stripe API integration"
# Generates: stripe-integration-agent.md
```

### Create Debug Agent
```bash
"Create an agent for debugging memory leaks"
# Generates: memory-debug-agent.md
```

## Agent Registry
Track all created agents in `.claude/agents/registry.json`:
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "payment-feature",
      "created": "2024-01-15",
      "purpose": "Payment implementation",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices
- Keep agents focused on single responsibility
- Include relevant context paths
- Define clear output expectations
- Add validation commands
- Document dependencies

## Remember
Meta agents create structure, not implementation. They define HOW other agents should work.
